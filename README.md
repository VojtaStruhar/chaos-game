# Chaos Game - Fractal generator



## TODO

- **Export**
  - Put the recursive fractal calculation on a background thread?
    - There is no point in interacting with the UI while the thing is generating, it's just nice
- Snap points to a grid. Maybe just a square grid at first. Show guidance lines.
